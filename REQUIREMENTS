This artifact is Docker container and required Docker to build or run.
We used Docker version 26.1.4, but other compatible versions may also be suitable.

Building the artifact using the supplied source code and `Dockerfile` downloads dependencies from the internet according to standard dependency specification files (`build.gradle`, `environment.yml`).
However, our exported, pre-built container may be imported and run without an internet connection, as it already contains all dependencies.

To access the web-based partial modeling and data analysis environments in the artifact, a modern web browser (e.g., recent releases of Chromium, Firefox, or Safari) is needed.
To this end, the Docker container exposes ports 8888 and 8889, and local firewall settings should allow the browser to access these forwarded ports.

Benchmarks were executed on a laptop with a 4-core Intel CPU and 32 GiB of RAM.
Hardware with lesser specification may also be suitable, but may increase benchmark runtime and change benchmark results.

For preliminary checks, a selected subset of benchmarks is supplied that may take 15-30 minutes to execute.
The full benchmark suite may take up to 24 hours if all iterations time out, but may be much faster depending on the hardware configuration.
