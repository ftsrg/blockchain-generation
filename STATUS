We claim the **Available** badge:

* The artifact is available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12556827 under the Eclipse Public License - v2.0

We claim the **Functional** badge:

* The artifact contains benchmark and data analysis scripts that reproduce our evaluation from Section 5 of our paper. In particular,
  * The generated plots titled _Median of Refinery Model Generation Runtime and Success rate_ support claims made about the runtime and success rate of Refinery in Section 5.3 of our paper by reproducing Figure 12.
  * The generated plots titled _Median of ASP solving time_ support claims made about the runtime of ASP solving in Section 5.3 of our paper by reproducing Figure 13.
  * The generated plots title _Cost/Resilience of the Solutions_ support claims made about the cost/resilience trade-off of generated architectures in Section 5.3 of our paper by reproducing Figure 14.
  * The generated models are a valid, diverse set of candidate blockchain architectures and are solutions the corresponding architecture generation problem. An example design is also shown in the paper in Figure 6.
* After running the benchmarks, these claims can be verified using the included Jupyter web-based data analysis environment.

We claim the **Reusable** badge:

* The structure of the artifact and our prototype tool is clearly documented to facilitate reuse and enable building new software tools and artifacts on it.
* The prototype can be reused to solve further blockchain architecture synthesis challenges. In particular,
  * A Refinery formalization of Hyperledger Fabric architectures is included in the artifact.
  * The Refinery and ASP problems can be customized to suit the synthesis challenge.
  * A Refinery web-based partial modeling environment is included to facilitate customizing the Refinery problems.
  * The prototype tool can be used to execute the synthesis.
  * A Jupyter web-based data analysis environment in included to analyze the cost/resilience trade-offs (or trade-offs in other metrics as formalized in the ASP problem).
